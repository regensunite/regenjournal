## Philosophy

### Local and private first

Whenever you do something, log it in your journal. No second thought. It's private by default. It's just for you.

### Peer to peer

No central server, no central authority

### Always in control

You decide what you share with whom

## Goal

Be the entry point to web3, the place where you keep track of your updates, contributions, praises and needs.
E.g.:
